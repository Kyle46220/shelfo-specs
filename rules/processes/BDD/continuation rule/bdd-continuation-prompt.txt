# Continue BDD Workflow: {{FEATURE_NAME}}

I'm continuing the BDD workflow for the **{{FEATURE_NAME}}** feature in the **{{MODULE_NAME}}** module. We are currently at the **{{CURRENT_STAGE}}** stage (**{{CURRENT_CHECKPOINT}}**).

## Current Acceptance Criteria Status

{{ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}}

## Instructions

Please analyze the loaded files and continue the BDD workflow from the current checkpoint. Follow these steps:

1. Review the current implementation status
2. Identify what needs to be completed next
3. Continue implementation according to BDD workflow stages:
   - Story Creation
   - Feature Creation
   - Steps Definition
   - BDD Implementation
   - Unit Testing
   - Scenario Completion
   - Feature Documentation

4. Focus on completing the current stage before moving to the next
5. Focus on completing the current stage without worrying about documentation updates

I'd like to resume exactly where we left off without repeating completed work. Focus only on implementation and testing - I'll handle updating task status and documentation separately.
